Hadoop publishes user interfaces as web sites hosted on the master node and slave nodes
only available on node's local web server 
not publically available over the internet

option 1
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-ssh-tunnel-local.html
use an SSH client to connect with the master node
configure SSH tunneling with local port forwarding
use internet browser to open web interfaces hosted on the master node

to connect with the local web server on the master node
create SSH tunnel between your computer and the master node = port forwarding
to get the response of the web server running on the master node

replace ec2-###-##-##-###.compute-1.amazonaws.com with master node DNS name

ssh -N -L 8157:ec2-###-##-##-###.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8088 hadoop@ec2-###-##-##-###.compute-1.amazonaws.com

terminal remains open until you close ssh session
view resource manager web interface on my machine's browser at http://localhost:8157


option 2
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-ssh-tunnel.html
use SSH client to connect with master node
configure SSH tunneling with dynamic port forwarding
configure internet browser using chrome extension to manage SOCKS proxy settings

if you create the SSH tunnel using port forwarding 
all traffic routed to the specified unused local port is forwarded to the local web server on the master node
this creates a SOCKS proxy

this method allows you to automatically filter URLs based on text patterns
and limit proxy settings to domains that match the form of the master node's DNS name

chrome extension will automatically handle turning the proxy on and off 
when you switch between websites on the master node and those on the internet 

ssh -N -D 8157 hadoop@ec2-###-##-##-###.compute-1.amazonaws.com

-D for dynamic port forwarding
allows you to specify a local port used to forward data to all remote ports on master node's local web server
creates a local SOCKS proxy listening to the port specified 

the terminal will remain open and not return a response
when done with using the web interfaces close the ssh session

configure the SOCKS proxy for the browser 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-connect-master-node-proxy.html
proxy handles turning proxy on and off 
when you switch between websites hosted on master node and those hosted on the internet 
specify the the urls you want to use the proxy for
